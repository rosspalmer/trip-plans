## Travel Times

Getting to activites in the valley generally takes **4hr**
from Denver. Different activites can be **0.5-2.0hr** from
each other within the valley.

Travelling into the valley from Denver can be accomplished
coming in from the north using the mountain 285 route or
go south using the interstate via I25 and then west 160.
The mountain route is often shorter and more enjoyable but
can be clogged to a standstill, especially on a Sunday. 
The I25 route is longer and involves the worst driving in
CO but is realible in weather and holiday traffic.

Here is a list of travel times:

**Denver (via Salida on 285)**
- [Salida](): 2.5hr 142 miles
- [Moffat](): 3.2hr 181 miles
- [Crestone](): 3.5hr 194 miles
